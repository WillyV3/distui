## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

## User Scenarios & Testing

### Primary User Story
As a Go developer with multiple projects, I want to manage all my release distributions from a single TUI application that remembers my project configurations globally, so I can release any project in under 30 seconds without polluting my repositories with configuration files.

### Acceptance Scenarios

#### Completed Features ‚úÖ
1. **Given** I'm in a Go project directory, **When** I launch distui, **Then** the app detects the project from git remotes and go.mod and loads any existing configuration from ~/.distui ‚úÖ
2. **Given** I have multiple Go projects configured, **When** I press TAB in the TUI, **Then** I can cycle between Project view, Global view (all projects), and Settings view ‚úÖ
3. **Given** I'm setting up a new project, **When** the app detects repository info, **Then** I can override any detected values before saving the configuration ‚úÖ
4. **Given** I have uncommitted changes, **When** I view the cleanup tab, **Then** I can see file categorization (config, code, docs, etc.) with smart suggestions for commit/ignore ‚úÖ
5. **Given** I want to commit changes, **When** I use smart commit, **Then** files are categorized automatically and committed with AI-generated messages ‚úÖ
6. **Given** I need a GitHub repository, **When** I create it from the TUI, **Then** I can select personal/org account, set visibility, and have the remote added automatically ‚úÖ
7. **Given** I have unpushed commits, **When** I view status, **Then** I see commit count and can push with [P] key ‚úÖ
8. **Given** the repository is clean and synced, **When** I view status, **Then** I see "All synced!" message ‚úÖ

#### Release Workflow ‚úÖ
9. **Given** I'm in Project view with a configured project, **When** I initiate a release, **Then** the app executes tests, creates tags, runs GoReleaser, updates Homebrew tap, and optionally publishes to NPM within 30 seconds ‚úÖ
10. **Given** a release is in progress, **When** commands execute, **Then** I see animated progress with package-manager style UI showing each step ‚úÖ
11. **Given** I'm viewing NPM configuration, **When** I check a package name, **Then** the system detects similar packages (not just exact matches) and shows availability status with suggestions if conflicts exist ‚úÖ
12. **Given** NPM detects a package conflict, **When** I press 'e' on the NPM item, **Then** I can edit the package name inline without leaving the distributions tab ‚úÖ
13. **Given** I have projects with different distribution needs, **When** I configure each project, **Then** each maintains its own distribution channel settings (GitHub only, Homebrew+GitHub, NPM+GitHub, etc.) ‚úÖ
14. **Given** I've made configuration changes, **When** I attempt to release without regenerating files, **Then** the system blocks the release and shows a warning ‚úÖ
15. **Given** I publish to NPM, **When** the release completes, **Then** package.json version bump is automatically committed and pushed ‚úÖ
16. **Given** I own an NPM package, **When** the system checks availability, **Then** it recognizes my ownership and marks the package as available ‚úÖ

### Edge Cases (Handled ‚úÖ)
- NPM package names with similar variants (hyphens/underscores) detected and flagged ‚úÖ
- User owns existing NPM package - recognized and marked as available ‚úÖ
- Configuration changes require file regeneration - releases blocked until regenerated ‚úÖ
- Package.json modified during NPM publish - auto-committed and pushed ‚úÖ
- Working tree checks don't flash during NPM publish (check order optimized) ‚úÖ
- Cleanup tab auto-refreshes when switching tabs after config changes ‚úÖ
- ESC during NPM name editing cancels edit mode, not entire view ‚úÖ
