## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

## User Scenarios & Testing

### Primary User Story
As a Go developer with multiple projects, I want to manage all my release distributions from a single TUI application that remembers my project configurations globally, so I can release any project in under 30 seconds without polluting my repositories with configuration files.

### Acceptance Scenarios

#### Completed Features ‚úÖ
1. **Given** I'm in a Go project directory, **When** I launch distui, **Then** the app detects the project from git remotes and go.mod and loads any existing configuration from ~/.distui ‚úÖ
2. **Given** I have multiple Go projects configured, **When** I press TAB in the TUI, **Then** I can cycle between Project view, Global view (all projects), and Settings view ‚úÖ
3. **Given** I'm setting up a new project, **When** the app detects repository info, **Then** I can override any detected values before saving the configuration ‚úÖ
4. **Given** I have uncommitted changes, **When** I view the cleanup tab, **Then** I can see file categorization (config, code, docs, etc.) with smart suggestions for commit/ignore ‚úÖ
5. **Given** I want to commit changes, **When** I use smart commit, **Then** files are categorized automatically and committed with AI-generated messages ‚úÖ
6. **Given** I need a GitHub repository, **When** I create it from the TUI, **Then** I can select personal/org account, set visibility, and have the remote added automatically ‚úÖ
7. **Given** I have unpushed commits, **When** I view status, **Then** I see commit count and can push with [P] key ‚úÖ
8. **Given** the repository is clean and synced, **When** I view status, **Then** I see "All synced!" message ‚úÖ

#### Pending Features üîÑ
9. **Given** I'm in Project view with a configured project, **When** I initiate a release, **Then** the app executes tests, creates tags, runs GoReleaser, updates Homebrew tap, and optionally publishes to NPM within 30 seconds
10. **Given** a release is in progress, **When** commands execute, **Then** I see animated progress with package-manager style UI showing each step
11. **Given** a release is in progress, **When** a command fails, **Then** I see the error output in real-time and can choose how to proceed interactively
12. **Given** I have projects with different distribution needs, **When** I configure each project, **Then** each maintains its own distribution channel settings (GitHub only, Homebrew+GitHub, NPM+GitHub, etc.)
13. **Given** I prefer CI/CD over local releases, **When** I configure the project, **Then** I can generate GitHub Actions workflows for automated releases

### Edge Cases
- What happens when gh CLI is not installed or not authenticated?
- How does system handle when homebrew tap location doesn't exist?
- What occurs if project has no go.mod file?
- How does app respond when ~/.distui directory is not writable?
- What happens during concurrent releases of different projects?
- How does system handle when detected values conflict with saved configuration?

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements

#### Core Infrastructure (Completed ‚úÖ)
- **FR-001**: System MUST detect Go projects by reading git remote origin and go.mod files in the current directory ‚úÖ
- **FR-002**: System MUST store all configuration data in ~/.distui directory, never adding files to user repositories ‚úÖ
- **FR-003**: System MUST provide three navigable views: Project (current project), Global (all projects list), and Settings ‚úÖ
- **FR-004**: Users MUST be able to switch between views using TAB key or dedicated keyboard shortcuts ‚úÖ
- **FR-007**: System MUST remember project configurations globally, allowing instant access when revisiting projects ‚úÖ
- **FR-009**: System MUST use gh CLI for smart detection of repositories, taps, and authentication status ‚úÖ
- **FR-010**: Users MUST be able to override any automatically detected values ‚úÖ

#### Git Management (Completed ‚úÖ)
- **FR-019**: System MUST categorize uncommitted files by type (config, code, docs, build, assets, data, other) ‚úÖ
- **FR-020**: System MUST allow per-file actions (commit, skip, ignore) in cleanup view ‚úÖ
- **FR-021**: System MUST provide smart commit with AI-generated commit messages based on file changes ‚úÖ
- **FR-022**: System MUST support creating GitHub repositories from TUI with account/org selection ‚úÖ
- **FR-023**: System MUST detect unpushed commits and provide push action ‚úÖ
- **FR-024**: System MUST show "All synced!" when repository is clean and pushed ‚úÖ
- **FR-025**: System MUST support file-by-file commit workflow with custom messages ‚úÖ
- **FR-026**: System MUST provide repository browser for navigating project files ‚úÖ

#### Release Workflow (Pending üîÑ)
- **FR-005**: System MUST execute release processes directly from the TUI including: running tests, creating git tags, executing GoReleaser, updating Homebrew formulas, and publishing to NPM
- **FR-006**: System MUST complete typical release execution within 30 seconds
- **FR-008**: System MUST support configuration of distribution channels per project (GitHub releases, Homebrew tap settings, NPM package settings)
- **FR-011**: System MUST display real-time command output during release execution with package-manager style animated progress
- **FR-012**: System MUST provide interactive error handling when commands fail
- **FR-013**: System MUST maintain release history for each project
- **FR-014**: System MUST support generating GitHub Actions workflows for CI/CD as an alternative to local execution
- **FR-015**: System MUST allow configuration of Homebrew tap location and formula names per project
- **FR-016**: System MUST allow configuration of NPM package names and settings per project
- **FR-017**: System MUST work with projects that have some but not all distribution channels enabled
- **FR-018**: System MUST provide visual progress indicators during long-running operations using package-manager example pattern
- **FR-027**: System MUST bump version numbers automatically or allow user to specify version
- **FR-028**: System MUST validate GoReleaser configuration before executing release
- **FR-029**: System MUST support rollback if release fails mid-process
- **FR-030**: System MUST show live streaming output for each release step (tests, build, publish)

- **Release History**: Record of past releases including version, date, method (local/CI), and status
- **Global Settings**: User-wide preferences including default Homebrew tap location, NPM scope, and UI preferences
- **File Change**: Represents uncommitted file with path, status (modified/added/deleted/untracked), and category
- **Cleanup Item**: UI representation of file with action (commit/skip/ignore)
- **Commit Model**: State for commit view including selected files and commit message
